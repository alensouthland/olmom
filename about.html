The genesis of the little Blue Book seems mysterious and requires explanation: A young man, who did not correspond to the normal image of knowledge and learning, was able to communicate hundreds of messages in the most precise manner. Olive Dawson, his older sister, then began to write down these messages, compiled them in the the little blue book and began to publish them for a broader audience.";
